# Tic-Tac-Toe - Beginner Level

This is a simplified game of tic-tac-toe. The code has been completely written on Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook. 
The code has been written without using any Python packages, whatsoever. The coding is heavily based on the usage of looping in Python along with conditional statements. The game requires two players, Player_1 and Player_2, namely and the inputs for the movement of each of the two players has to be entered manually after running the programme.    

I am a beginner in the domain of coding and this is my first attempt at trying to replicate the game of tic-tac-toe from scratch. For years, I've heard people talking about how difficult the concept of coding is and its limitations. In fact, around 10 years back, I was told that I wasn't capable enough to understanding what coding meant or its essence. Standing 10 years apart, this is my humble attempt at proving myself to be otherwise. From my finite knowledge of what coding is, all that I can suggest is that it isn't rocket science. Just like any other field, it requires your time and patience. It demands exploration. In my opinion, coding is a relative concept and how good you get at it, depends on a lot of factors, the primary ones being, how well you can play around with the basics and how much time you're willing to give it.

To all the beginners out there, I hope you enjoy it! Do let me know about ways in which this piece of code can be optimized. 

Thank you!
